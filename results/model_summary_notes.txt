Model Summary Notes

- Both the logistic regression and random forest models achieved high overall accuracy (89–90%).
- However, neither model was able to correctly classify a single fracture case (class 1), leading to zero recall and F1-score for that class.
- This highlights a severe class imbalance problem, where the majority class (no fracture) dominates the model’s predictions.
- Despite good performance on non-fracture cases, these models are not useful for identifying at-risk patients without additional improvements.

Next Steps:
- Apply resampling techniques (SMOTE, random oversampling)
- Introduce additional features like fall history, BMI, or bone density
- Test alternative models such as XGBoost or cost-sensitive classifiers
- Evaluate performance using AUC and precision-recall curves
